# AudioBridge Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `app_icon.png` - The main application icon
- `send_icon.png` - Icon for the sender mode
- `receive_icon.png` - Icon for the receiver mode
- `settings_icon.png` - Icon for settings
- `connect_icon.png` - Icon for connected status
- `disconnect_icon.png` - Icon for disconnected status

Since this is a prototype, you can use any suitable icons. You can find free icons at:
- [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)

## Placeholder Icons

For now, the application will run without these icons, but you'll see empty spaces where the icons should be. To fully implement the UI, you'll need to add these icon files to this directory.
